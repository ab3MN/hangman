## ðŸ“Œ How to Play

1. A random word is selected, and players see blank spaces representing each letter.
2. Guess letters one by one. Correct guesses reveal the letters; incorrect guesses add a part to the hangman.
3. Keep guessing until you complete the word or the hangman is fully drawn.
4. Use hints if needed, but be carefulâ€”they might reduce your score!
